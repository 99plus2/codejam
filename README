This branch contains my submissions to earlier Google Code Jam events.
It serves the dual purpose of:

• having a more convenient interface than the official site's
  “download other contestant's submission”

• providing a somewhat canonical URI with syntax highlighting for most
  of the languages used

Only solutions that were actually accepted during the contest are
present here.  This means that all the code here is supposed to work
out of the box—please open an issue if you encounter a snippet that
doesn't.

It also means that all the code here was written under mild
(qualifiers) to extreme (online rounds) time pressure.  Definitely not
code intended to demonstrate a language or another's intrinsic beauty,
cool use of data structures or well-designed algorithms, or anything
like that.

For better-written solutions, see the eponymous branch.

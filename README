This branch contains solutions to Google Code Jam problems.

The tree isn't as clean as I'd like it to be—yet.  History took its
due: some of the entries went through heavy golfing, some of them are
in multiple languages, they were all written on separate boxes and
shoehorned together.

All solutions presented here are expected to work.  Please open an
issue through github if you encounter one that doesn't.

For actual time-pressured code I wrote during the official contests,
check out branch “submissions.”

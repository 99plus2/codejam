I was qualified for online round 2 through online round 1C.
Unfortunately, I had other commitments around the time of the event,
so I couldn't take part.  C'est la vie!

Hindsight judges I could have made it on A (both), B (both) and
C-small without external help.  Whether I'd have done them in time is
a whole different story.
